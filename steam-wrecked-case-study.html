                <h2>Background</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>In this collaborative project, students from the Programming and Game Artist programs worked alongside us UX students to create a complete game experience. The Game Artist team developed the game itself, programmers implemented the website, and our role as UX designers was to design the site to represent the game and its creators. I collaborated closely with another UX student to deliver the UX design for the project.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The challenge was to create a functional and visually consistent website in under two weeks. The site needed to include information about the game, introduce the development team, and showcase media material connected to the game. Despite the tight timeline, the website also had to reflect the game's artistic style and provide an intuitive user experience.</p>

                <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Our research included reviewing reference websites for other indie and student-led games. We received visual assets from the Game Artist team and drew inspiration from the game's style to ensure a consistent graphic language. While we were given creative freedom, it was essential that the site's layout and atmosphere aligned with the game's unique identity.</p>

                    <p>We began by brainstorming concepts and sketching initial wireframes, testing different structures for how to present information in a clear and engaging way. Frames were iterated and refined collaboratively, with continuous debrief sessions involving the whole team. These feedback loops ensured that the website represented not only the game but also the collective effort of all disciplines involved.</p>
