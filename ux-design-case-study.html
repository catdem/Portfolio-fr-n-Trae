                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Farm Party is a cooperative digital game where children play as farm animals preparing a secret barn party without being discovered by the farmer. The project was developed as part of a UX design case study, focusing on creating an engaging and accessible player experience for families and children.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game combines elements of stealth, cooperation, and humor to create a child-friendly experience that encourages teamwork while maintaining an appropriate level of excitement and challenge for young players.</p>

                    <p>The main challenge was to design a game that balances simplicity with engagement. The game needed to be intuitive for young players while still offering cooperative depth. Another key concern was ensuring that the farmer character created excitement and suspense without being too frightening, as the target audience was children.</p>
